                <h4>Jul 2018 - Dec 2018</h4>
                <p>This particular project is my first ever application based project which is based on an Android Application created from scratch. Therefore, the report might look a little bit inefficient. This android application is meant to store and retrieve student details to and from a database. The faculty will be able to store the details via the app, which will forwarded to the database, and from the app they will be able to retrieve those details.

                <h4>Jan 2019 - Jun 2019</h4>
                <p>The android application, Digital Vehicle Entry Log System, is aimed for the security guards, through which they can record the vehicles, entered into the building and also will be able to keep track of their entry time. This app will have OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to detect text from images for storing the vehicleâ€™s number plate.

                <h4>Jul 2018 - Dec 2018</h4>
                <p>This particular project is an android application, which aims for every such user who has to work with documents, like for example - students, who has to deal with notes, books etc. The app will allow them to make notes in a jiffy, just by pointing the camera on the page which the user wants to extract, and the user will be able to make documents from it. Also, for such users, who prefer listening rather than reading, this app will convert the text to audio and they would be able to listen to it.
